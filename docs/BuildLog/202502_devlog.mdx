# 🗓️ February 2025 Build Log

February 2025 was a **concentrated, high-output month** focused on AI automation, document chunking, RAG pipelines, LangGraph/Langflow, metadata handling, and course design. This sprint log captures advanced systems I developed as a solo ML/AI engineer.

---

### ✅ Feb 27: Autoencoders for Socioeconomic Embedding

> I developed an MLP autoencoder for census-based representation learning using BigQuery and Python pipelines, exploring ethics and dimensionality.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/socioeconomic-embedding-autoencoders/)  
> 🔗 [Notebook](/repos/socioeconomic-embedding-autoencoders/census_autoencoder.ipynb)

---

### ✅ Feb 23: Automated Curriculum Builder with Bibliography Tooling

> I created a modular AI-driven curriculum builder, including automated bibliography and syllabus generation for teaching frameworks.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/ai-course-builder/)  
> 🔗 [Post](https://example.com/designing-courses-with-ai-support)

---

### ✅ Feb 18–21: FAISS-Based Summarization and Retrieval Enhancements

> I developed multi-pass summarization and embedding workflows, resolved integration issues, and implemented improved FAISS pipeline resets.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/faiss-text-summary-engine/)

---

### ✅ Feb 17: Graph-Based Retrieval and Email Data NLP Pipelines

> I built graph-based document search with Cassandra, enhanced metadata NLP and email embeddings, and structured a memory system for entity-aware retrieval.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/graph-nlp-retrieval/)  
> 🔗 [Notebook](/repos/graph-nlp-retrieval/email_graph_memory.ipynb)

---

### ✅ Feb 14–15: Langflow Automation & Flowise Integration

> I explored and debugged Flowise for automated knowledge workflows, implemented webhook flows, and resolved system dependencies.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/flowise-pipeline/)  
> 🔗 [Post](https://example.com/agent-ux-langflow-flowise)

---

### ✅ Feb 10–12: RAG System Modularization + FAISS Indexing Toolkit

> I unified the RAG codebase into discrete modules, integrated FAISS, enhanced embedding/query pipelines, and refactored the DirectoryProcessor for reliability.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/rag-modular/)  
> 🔗 [Docs](/repos/rag-modular/rag_modular_architecture.md)

---

### ✅ Feb 07–08: LangGraph-Based Book Composer with ChunkHandler

> I developed and refactored a system for document drafting via chunk routing, LangGraph workflow design, and AI agent composition.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/langgraph-book-compiler/)  
> 🔗 [Diagram](/repos/langgraph-book-compiler/chunk-agent-flow.png)

---

### ✅ Feb 05–06: Modular Financial Processing Engine

> I refactored accounting and bill management into a pivot-based, modular processing system for financial documents and ledgers.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/finance-pipeline/)  
> 🔗 [Notebook](/repos/finance-pipeline/bills_to_reports.ipynb)

---

### ✅ Feb 04: AI-Powered Political Consultancy Framework

> I designed a modular AI strategy engine for political scenario modeling and discourse structuring, focusing on workflow design, modularity, and use-case alignment.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/ai-political-strategy/)  
> 🔗 [Post](https://example.com/designing-ai-tooling-for-political-praxis)

---

### ✅ Feb 01–03: Supabase File Sync & Metadata-Powered RAG System

> I built an automated Supabase-integrated file ingestion pipeline for RAG indexing, including error handling, `created_at` patching, and vector DB integration.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/repos/rag-supabase-file-sync/)  
> 🔗 [Diagram](/repos/rag-supabase-file-sync/file-to-vector-pipeline.png)
