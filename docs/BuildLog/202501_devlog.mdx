> 🔗 [Draft](/RAG_Sync/ContentSummarizer/economic-variance-insights.md)

---

### ✅ Jan 09: AI-Driven Repository Management + Thesis Framework

> I developed an end-to-end repository parsing system with an OCR-to-CSV pipeline and an AI-assisted thesis content management tool.  
> 🔗 [Repo](/AIAnalyzer/)  
> 🔗 [Notebook](/AIAnalyzer/thesis-manager.ipynb)

---

### ✅ Jan 07: Municipal Invoice Automation System

> I automated PDF generation and messaging workflows for municipal billing using templated styling and schedule-based dispatch.
